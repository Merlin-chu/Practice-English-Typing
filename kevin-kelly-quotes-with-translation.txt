On my sixty-eighth birthday, I decided to give my young adult children some advice.
在我 68 岁生日那天，我决定给我已成年的孩子们一些建议。

So for the next several years I wrote down a batch of advice on my birthday, and shared it with my family and friends.
于是在接下来的几年里，我每年生日都会写下一批建议，分享给家人和朋友。
They wanted more.

I kept going until I had about 450 bits of advice I wished I’d known when I was younger.
我一直写下去，直到积累了约 450 条 —— 都是我年轻时希望自己能知道的道理。
I am primarily channeling the wisdom of the ages.
这些话主要是在传递历代积累的智慧。
I am offering advice I have heard from others, or timeless knowledge repeated from the past, or a modern aphorism that matched my own experience.
有的是我从别人那里听来的，有的是流传至今的古老智慧，有的是契合我自身经历的现代格言。
I doubt any of it is truly original, although I have tried to put everything in my own words.
我不确定其中有多少是真正原创的，但我确实努力用自己的话来表达。
I think of these bits as seeds because each one of them could easily be expanded into a long essay.
我把这些话看作种子 —— 每一条都能轻易扩展成一篇长文。
Indeed, I have spent most of my time writing by compressing these substantial lessons into as compact and tweetable forms as possible.
事实上，我花了大量时间做的，就是把这些深刻的经验压缩成简洁到能发一条推文的形式。
You are encouraged to expand these seeds as you read to fill your own situation.
希望你读的时候，能结合自己的处境，让这些种子生根发芽。
If you find these proverbs align with your experience, share them with someone younger than yourself.
如果你觉得这些格言与你的经历相符，就把它们分享给比你年轻的人吧。
